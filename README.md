We live in a rapidly changing world. :earth_africa:

What if we can build a better future than we currently imagine? :crystal_ball:

**I am [Suriyaa](https://about.suriyaa.tk/) and welcome to my GitHub profile page. I build software.**

By connecting entrepreneurship and technology, I am passionate about making open source technology more accessible to everyone, enabling anyone to better their life circumstances.

Together we can create new frontiers of human ambition and possibilities to [improve the world](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) significantly.

Why are we still waiting? Let's get started! :rocket:
